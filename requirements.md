# Requirements for ReasoningBank Library

## 1. Core Functionality

- **Memory Storage:** The system must provide a mechanism to store agent experiences. These experiences include both successful and failed trajectories.
- **Memory Distillation:** The system must be able to distill raw trajectories into a structured, reusable format. This format, as described in the paper, should include a title, description, and content.
- **Memory Retrieval:** The system must provide a mechanism to retrieve relevant memories based on a given query or context. The retrieval should be based on semantic similarity.
- **Self-Correction and Learning:** The system should be able to learn from both successes and failures, as identified by an LLM-as-a-judge or a similar mechanism.
- **Integration with Agentic Frameworks:** The library should be designed to be easily integrated with popular agentic frameworks like LangChain.

## 2. MaTTS (Memory-aware Test-Time Scaling)

- **Parallel Scaling:** The system must support the generation of multiple trajectories in parallel for a single query to identify consistent reasoning patterns.
- **Sequential Scaling:** The system must support iterative refinement of a single trajectory to improve the quality of the solution and the extracted memory.

## 3. Technical Requirements

- **Python Implementation:** The core library must be implemented in Python.
- **Memory Backend:** The system should support a pluggable memory backend. The initial implementation will use ChromaDB, but it should be possible to extend it to other backends like FAISS or a simple JSON file with embeddings.
- **Dependencies:** The library should have a clear `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file to manage dependencies.

## 4. Documentation

- **README.md:** A comprehensive README file with installation instructions, usage examples, and a brief overview of the library.
- **API Documentation:** Clear and concise documentation for the public API of the library.

## 5. Testing

- **Unit Tests:** The library must have a suite of unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual components.
- **Integration Tests:** The library must have integration tests to ensure that the different components work together as expected, and to test the integration with LangChain.
